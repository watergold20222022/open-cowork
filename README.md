Kimi CLI is an AI agent that runs in the terminal, helping you complete software development tasks and terminal operations. It can read and edit code, execute shell commands, search and fetch web pages, and autonomously plan and adjust actions during execution.

**Kimi Cowork** is a Windows desktop application built on top of Kimi CLI, providing a graphical interface similar to Claude Cowork. It allows you to work with folders through a desktop UI, manage multiple projects, and delegate tasks to the AI agent without needing to use the terminal.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Kimi CLI is currently in technical preview. Kimi Cowork (Windows Desktop App) is under active development.

## Getting Started

### Kimi CLI (Terminal)

See [Getting Started](https://moonshotai.github.io/kimi-cli/en/guides/getting-started.html) for how to install and start using Kimi CLI.

### Kimi Cowork (Windows Desktop)

> [!NOTE]
> Kimi Cowork for Windows is currently under development. Check back soon for installation instructions.

Kimi Cowork provides a desktop application experience for Windows users:
- **Folder-based workflows**: Point the app at specific directories for AI-assisted work
- **Graphical interface**: No terminal required - interact through a familiar desktop UI
- **Project management**: Manage multiple workspace folders and sessions
- **Background execution**: Delegate tasks and continue working while the AI processes in the background
- **Built on Kimi CLI**: Leverages the same powerful agent architecture with a user-friendly interface

## Key Features

### Kimi Cowork (Windows Desktop App)

**Desktop folder access**: Work with specific folders on your computer through a graphical interface. The AI agent can:
- Read and organize files within authorized folders
- Create and modify documents, spreadsheets, and code files
- Execute multi-step workflows across your file system
- Manage projects with visual task tracking

**Orchestration UI**: See the AI's work progress in real-time:
- View active steps and tool usage
- Track sub-agent spawning and parallel task execution
- Monitor file changes and command outputs
- Approve or reject actions through dialog prompts

**Session management**: 
- Create and switch between multiple workspace sessions
- Resume previous work automatically
- Keep work isolated per project folder

### Kimi CLI (Terminal)

#### Shell command mode

Kimi CLI is not only a coding agent, but also a shell. You can switch the shell command mode by pressing `Ctrl-X`. In this mode, you can directly run shell commands without leaving Kimi CLI.

> [!NOTE]
> Built-in shell commands like `cd` are not supported yet.

### IDE integration via ACP

Kimi CLI supports [Agent Client Protocol] out of the box. You can use it together with any ACP-compatible editor or IDE.

[Agent Client Protocol]: https://github.com/agentclientprotocol/agent-client-protocol

To use Kimi CLI with ACP clients, make sure to run Kimi CLI in the terminal and send `/setup` to complete the setup first. Then, you can configure your ACP client to start Kimi CLI as an ACP agent server with command `kimi acp`.

For example, to use Kimi CLI with [Zed](https://zed.dev/) or [JetBrains](https://blog.jetbrains.com/ai/2025/12/bring-your-own-ai-agent-to-jetbrains-ides/), add the following configuration to your `~/.config/zed/settings.json` or `~/.jetbrains/acp.json` file:

```json
{
  "agent_servers": {
    "Kimi CLI": {
      "command": "kimi",
      "args": ["acp"],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

Then you can create Kimi CLI threads in IDE's agent panel.

### Zsh integration

You can use Kimi CLI together with Zsh, to empower your shell experience with AI agent capabilities.

Install the [zsh-kimi-cli](https://github.com/MoonshotAI/zsh-kimi-cli) plugin via:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/MoonshotAI/zsh-kimi-cli.git \
  ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/kimi-cli
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you are using a plugin manager other than Oh My Zsh, you may need to refer to the plugin's README for installation instructions.

Then add `kimi-cli` to your Zsh plugin list in `~/.zshrc`:

```sh
plugins=(... kimi-cli)
```

After restarting Zsh, you can switch to agent mode by pressing `Ctrl-X`.

### MCP support

Kimi CLI supports MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools.

**`kimi mcp` sub-command group**

You can manage MCP servers with `kimi mcp` sub-command group. For example:

```sh
# Add streamable HTTP server:
kimi mcp add --transport http context7 https://mcp.context7.com/mcp --header "CONTEXT7_API_KEY: ctx7sk-your-key"

# Add streamable HTTP server with OAuth authorization:
kimi mcp add --transport http --auth oauth linear https://mcp.linear.app/mcp

# Add stdio server:
kimi mcp add --transport stdio chrome-devtools -- npx chrome-devtools-mcp@latest

# List added MCP servers:
kimi mcp list

# Remove an MCP server:
kimi mcp remove chrome-devtools

# Authorize an MCP server:
kimi mcp auth linear
```

**Ad-hoc MCP configuration**

Kimi CLI also supports ad-hoc MCP server configuration via CLI option.

Given an MCP config file in the well-known MCP config format like the following:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "context7": {
      "url": "https://mcp.context7.com/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "CONTEXT7_API_KEY": "YOUR_API_KEY"
      }
    },
    "chrome-devtools": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "chrome-devtools-mcp@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

Run `kimi` with `--mcp-config-file` option to connect to the specified MCP servers:

```sh
kimi --mcp-config-file /path/to/mcp.json
```
